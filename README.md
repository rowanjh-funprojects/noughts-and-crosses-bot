A bot that plays against you in Noughts and Crosses (tic-tac-toe). 

The AI uses the minimax algorithm to search for the optimal move. Alpha-beta pruning is used for efficiency.

The game is implemented in pygame, modified from code provided by "CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python" course.

To run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Play the game with `python runner.py`
